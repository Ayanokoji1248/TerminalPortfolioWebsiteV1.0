# Terminal Website V1.0
A simple and interactive terminal-style website designed to mimic the look and feel of a command-line interface. This project aims to provide a unique and nostalgic user experience by allowing visitors to interact with the website through text commands, similar to how they would operate a real terminal.

## Overview
The Terminal Website project recreates the retro terminal environment within a modern web browser. Inspired by classic command-line interfaces, this website lets users navigate and interact through commands, bringing back the charm of the early computing days. Whether you're a fan of vintage technology or just looking for a novel way to present content, this project offers an engaging and unconventional web experience.

NOTE:<b> It is not responsive & I might make V1.2</b>
